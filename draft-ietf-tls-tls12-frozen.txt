                      TLS 1.2 is in Feature Freeze
                   draft-ietf-tls-tls12-frozen-latest

Abstract

   Use of TLS 1.3 is growing and fixes some known deficiencies in TLS
   1.2.  This document specifies that outside of urgent security fixes,
   new TLS Exporter Labels, or new Application-Layer Protocol
   Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs, no changes will be approved for TLS
   1.2.  This prescription does not pertain to DTLS (in any DTLS
   version); it pertains to TLS only.

1.  Introduction

   Use of TLS 1.3 [TLS13] is growing, and it fixes most known
   deficiencies with TLS 1.2 [TLS12], such as encrypting more of the
   traffic so that it is not readable by outsiders and removing most
   cryptographic primitives now considered weak.  Importantly, TLS 1.3
   enjoys robust security proofs.

   Both versions have several extension points, so items like new
   cryptographic algorithms, new supported groups (formerly "named
   curves"), etc., can be added without defining a new protocol.  This
   document specifies that outside of urgent security fixes, and the
   exceptions listed in Section 4, no changes will be approved for TLS
   1.2.  This prescription does not pertain to DTLS (in any DTLS
   version); it pertains to TLS only.

2.  Implications for post-quantum cryptography

   Cryptographically relevant quantum computers, once available, will
   have a huge impact on RSA, FFDH, and ECC which are currently used in
   TLS.  In 2016, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology
   started a multi-year effort to standardize algorithms that will be
   "safe" once quantum computers are feasible [PQC].  First discussions
   in the IETF community happened around the same time [CFRGSLIDES].

   In 2024 NIST released standards for [ML-KEM], [ML-DSA], and
   [SLH-DSA].  While industry was waiting for NIST to finish
   standardization, the IETF has had several efforts underway.  A
   working group was formed in early 2023 to work on use of PQC in IETF
   protocols, [PQUIPWG].  Several other working groups, including TLS
   [TLSWG], are working on drafts to support hybrid algorithms and
   identifiers, for use during a transition from classic to a post-
   quantum world.

   For TLS it is important to note that the focus of these efforts is
   exclusively TLS 1.3 or later.  Put bluntly, post-quantum cryptography
   for TLS 1.2 WILL NOT be supported (see Section 4) at any time and
   anyone wishing to deploy post-quantum cryptography should expect to
   be using TLS 1.3.

3.  Security Considerations

   This entire document is about security, and provides post-quantum
   concerns as an additional reason to upgrade to TLS 1.3.

4.  IANA Considerations

   No registries are being closed by this document.  Rather, this
   document modifies the instructions to IANA and the TLS Designed
   Experts to constrain what type of entries can be added.

   There are no limits on the registrations for either of the following
   two registries:

   *  TLS Exporter Labels

   *  TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs

   Entries in any other TLS protocol registry should have an informal
   indication indication like "For TLS 1.3 or later" in their entry.
   Anywhere is fine; the "Comment" column is a good place.
